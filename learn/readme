The Sliders example shows how to use the different types of sliders available in Qt: QSlider, QScrollBar and QDial.

Qt provides three types of slider-like widgets: QSlider, QScrollBar and QDial. They all inherit most of their functionality from QAbstractSlider, and can in theory replace each other in an application since the differences only concern their look and feel. This example shows what they look like, how they work and how their behavior and appearance can be manipulated through their properties.

The example also demonstrates how signals and slots can be used to synchronize the behavior of two or more widgets.
